# Showy

*Showy is an image viewer on the Web for viewing your local files online.*

Showy uses some of the latest features of the web platform such as File API,
Blob URLs, &lt;input type=range&gt;, DnD, CSS Tranforms, and others. It has been
developed with Chrome 24, and it may not work well in other browsers yet. The
app is almost fully keyboard-driven in addition to usual touch and mouse
controls.

Showy, your flamboyant image viewer on the Web.
